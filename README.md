Python v3.8.1

Author: pyFlummox

version: 1.2.0.1

Destiny 2 Season of Arrivals has introduced an AFK forge farm for mats. There was a patch that sent you to orbit after completing a forge.
I have created this simple script that acts as a macro to relaunch forges. All you need to do to launch the program is install pyautogui. 
This is the only thing used that doesn't come with default python 3.8. 

This code is very simple and isn't perfect. I threw it together in an after noon. I'm keeping this on GitHub to help others and share my 
knowledge on how destiny 2 works. 

currently this isn't support for 1080p and I don't plan on adding that unless highly requested as the ratios are pretty different on 1080p. 

Future features that could come. 
Picture recognition on the "Open Directory" from Destiny 2's orbit screen and/or the forge icon. This could save time but it isn't instant as finding pictures on screens is slow. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions on the script. thanks. 


If you want a compiled version please download from here. I compiled with pyinstaller
